Crisis Response Team a.k.a Dr. Beat
==================

Dr. Beat is a game jam entry for the theme "Crisis Response Team". 

It's a two-player cooperative crazytaxi-like across two computers. One player is the driver, who must steer the ambulance to the next crisis. The other player is the navigator, who can where the crisis *actually is* on the map. 

It works best when the players are opposite each-other.
